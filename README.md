Firstly, the concept of depression is central to our study. Depression is a complex mental health disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest, and changes in cognitive and physical functioning. Detecting depression signs from social media text involves analyzing linguistic cues, sentiment, and other textual features that indicate the presence of depressive symptoms.
Secondly, we utilize a fully connected customized deep learning model in conjunction with a machine learning model, specifically Random Forest, for depression sign classification. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. By integrating Random Forest into our approach, we aim to leverage the complementary strengths of deep learning and machine learning techniques.
